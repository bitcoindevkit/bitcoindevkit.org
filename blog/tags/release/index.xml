      <description>A new release of BDK is out: the v0.3.0 is a relatively small update compared to v0.2.0, but it still brings some nice APIs improvements and general bugfixes.
You can find the full v0.3.0 changelog on GitHub.
What&amp;rsquo;s new in v0.3.0 Below are some highlights of the new improved APIs coming with this release:
Less verbosity when using Wallet::new_offline() Now you don&amp;rsquo;t have to explicitly provide the OfflineWallet&amp;lt;_&amp;gt; type anymore, saving you one import and making it much less verbose to use.</description>

      <description>A new release of BDK is finally out! The v0.2.0 release contains many exciting new features, bug fixes and overall improvements. This release also marks the beginning of our new regular release schedule, which will see us pushing out a new release every four weeks. We think this is a good compromise to ensure that developers using BDK have access to all the new features and fixes as soon as possible, at least while the library is still evolving very fast as it is right now.</description>

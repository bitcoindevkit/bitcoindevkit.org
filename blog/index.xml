      <description>Introduction Compact Filters: Compact filters are the latest specification of Bitcoin SPV node implementation as per BIP157 and BIP158. Such light clients were envisioned by Satoshi himself in his original white paper, but due to lack of robust privacy and trust guarantees using conventional bloomfilters, these type of nodes never got popular.
Enters BIP157, which described a new type of filters for Bitcoin Blockchain data, known as compact_filters. The Neutrino project pioneered the use of compact filter based light client nodes for using with Lightning Network wallets.</description>

      <title>Descriptor-based paper wallets</title>
      <link>https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/2021/03/descriptor-based-paper-wallets/</link>

      <guid>https://bitcoindevkit.org/blog/2021/03/descriptor-based-paper-wallets/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we will use the Rusty Paper Wallet tool to create a multi-owned descriptor-based paper wallet. We will use bdk via the bdk-cli tool to test our descriptor and to be able to sweep the funds from our paper wallet to a new address.
About paper wallets Paper wallets have a lot of drawbacks, as explained in the paper wallet Wiki article, as always, do your own research before deciding to use it with mainnet bitcoins.</description>

 The dataset  The mempool The outliers Recap    The dataset The dataset is publicly available (~500MB gzip compressed, ~2GB as plain CSV).
The output of the model is the fee rate, expressed in [satoshi/vbytes].
What about the inputs? Generally speaking, we have two main requirements for what can be included as input for our model:</description>

      <description>A new release of BDK is finally out! The v0.2.0 release contains many exciting new features, bug fixes and overall improvements. This release also marks the beginning of our new regular release schedule, which will see us pushing out a new release every four weeks. We think this is a good compromise to ensure that developers using BDK have access to all the new features and fixes as soon as possible, at least while the library is still evolving very fast as it is right now.</description>

      <description>I have tried to setup a 2 of 2 multi signature infrastructure with two different wallets, which know nothing about each other, but are compliant with two very important protocols: Output Descriptors and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions described in BIP 174.
Before these two protocols came into existence, making a multi signature setup and spending from it was possible only if the involved parties were using the same wallet (eg. Electrum Desktop Wallet).</description>

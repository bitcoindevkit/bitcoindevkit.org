The Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK) Foundation is happy to announce our first new corporate members for 2025 - [AnchorWatch](https://www.anchorwatch.com/), [CleanSpark](https://www.cleanspark.com/), and [Proton Foundation](https://proton.me/foundation)! A big thanks to our new Foundation members as well as our founding members [Spiral](https://spiral.xyz/) and [OpenSats](https://opensats.org/) for supporting our mission. Corporate members yearly dues support the small team of open source developers who maintain the core BDK libraries and related, supporting FOSS projects.

The BDK Foundation is a US non-profit organization with the mission to promote the common business interests of the Bitcoin software development industry. To that end the Foundation focuses on enhancing the capabilities of businesses, individuals, and organizations who use Bitcoin related technology in their products and services. The primary way the Foundation carries out this mission is through our stewardship of free and open source (FOSS) tools such as the BDK suite of libraries and related training material. The Foundation also hosts forums for developer mentoring and networking, and in-person talks and workshops.

We invite all businesses big or small who support the BDK Foundation's mission to join us as corporate members. Please see our [membership](/foundation/become-a-member/) page for more information or contact us at [hello@bitcoindevkit.org](https://mailto:hello@bitcoindevkit.org/).

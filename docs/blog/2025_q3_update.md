Q3 saw a new feature release of the bdk_wallet library (`2.1.0`), with great new features being added including support for multipath descriptors, more flexible transaction building capabilities, as well as better caching when working with large wallets.

Here are some of the notable releases and changes over Q3 to the software libraries we maintain:
- **We have a new _Release Notes_ section** on the Book of BDK. Head over to the [book of BDK Release Guide section](https://bookofbdk.com/release-guide/2.2/notes/) for notes on the latest releases.
- **The Electrum, Esplora, and Kyoto client** have all gotten new releases with some small added features and bug fixes.
- **The Book of BDK examples have all been updated to reflect the new 2.0 APIs.** Check out [https://bookofbdk.com](https://bookofbdk.com)!
- **We've split up some of the language bindings libraries** into their own repositories in order to make it easier for devs to contribute to those, and for new languages to copy our workflow! Keep an eye out for our experimental React Native and Flutter libraries, to be announced later this year...
- **The work on Silent Payments** with BDK is ongoing with [nymius](https://github.com/nymius) working full-time on a range of libraries that must come together in the Rust ecosystem to bring this all the way down to wallet devs through BDK. Conferences, hackathons, example cli tools to showcase the workflows and libraries, Nymius is working hard to get Silent Payments in BDK!
- **Lots of new features** are being worked on as part of the preparation for a 3.0 release! See our [3.0 milestone](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk_wallet/milestone/3) for all the gory details. 

## Our Grantees in Action

Full-time grants changes:
- We now have [Luis](https://github.com/luisschwab) working on a project grant, integrating Floresta with BDK!

## BDK in the Wild

- Q3 saw new projects integrating BDK into their software, most notably [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) with a WASM language bindings library now maintained by the BDK Foundation ([see the repository here](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-wasm)).
- We have continued to record the BDK Tech Talk videos, and they're on YouTube! Check them out:

# Bitcoin Dev Kit Foundation

The BDK Foundation is a US non-profit organization with the mission to promote the common business interests of the Bitcoin software development industry. To that end the Foundation focuses on enhancing the capabilities of businesses, individuals, and organizations who use Bitcoin related technology in their products and services. The primary way the Foundation carries out this mission is through our stewardship of free and open source (FOSS) tools such as the BDK suite of libraries and related training material. The foundation also hosts forums for developer mentoring and networking, and in-person talks and workshops.

All work funded by the Foundation is required to be licensed as free and open source and is published free of charge on ours or other public websites. Any research documents or software code is published publicly on our website, in Github repositories, and/or on other similar free and publicly accessible systems.

We invite all businesses big or small who support the BDK Foundation's mission to [join us](/foundation/members) as corporate members.
